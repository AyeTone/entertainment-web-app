- Mobile-first workflow

- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

While completing this projects, When I started developing the Movies page I noticed a component that I made for one section could be used for mutiple section on the web app. This prompted me to refactoring what I already had so that I could make it into a reuseable componenet. Going forward, I would like to be able to spot these better so help improve upon my coding speed.
